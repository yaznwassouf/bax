  "Review": "There  was a time when choosing a BMW 3 Series over its primary rivals in the compact  luxury car segment was an easy decision, especially if you enjoy the act of  driving. Today, the 3 Series still adheres to the qualities that made it  popular in the first place and remains a rewarding choice for enthusiasts, but  it's no longer the only game in town. In addition, many alternatives to this  BMW offer appealing traits unavailable in a 3 Series, like an electric drive  system, a wagon body style, and more value for the money.;Last  year, the seventh-generation 3 Series received its midlife updates right on  schedule, and a redesign is rumored to arrive for the 2026 model year. So,  expect few, if any, changes to the 2024 BMW 3 Series. It continues with  turbocharged four- and six-cylinder gas engines and a turbocharged plug-in  hybrid powertrain, each paired with rear-wheel drive or BMW's xDrive  all-wheel-drive system. The high-performance M3 remains in the lineup but is  reviewed separately.;If  we sound lukewarm about the 2024 3 Series, know that we still enjoy getting  behind its steering wheel, firing up its engine, and seeking out fun roads to  explore. But this BMW faces more capable competitors than ever, which dilutes  its appeal. For additional perspective on the 3 Series check out the Edmunds  testing team's full Expert Rating of the car.;BMW  hasn't released official information on the 2024 3 Series as of this writing.  We'll update our recommendation if anything changes, but based on last year's 3  Series, we recommend the 330e plug-in hybrid version. It doesn't cost much more than a base 330i, but it  provides an estimated 22 miles of electric driving before switching to hybrid  operation. Better yet, there is no penalty in terms of performance.;[Editor's note: The following  unofficial information is based on last year's 3 Series. We expect the 2024  model will have a similar lineup and we'll update this section once we have  complete information.] The BMW 3 Series sedan lineup  includes the 330i, 330e and M340i. Each one has a slightly different mission. The 330i is the  entry-level 3 Series while the 330e is a plug-in hybrid. The M340i is the  sportiest and most powerful.

  "Review": "There  was a time when choosing a BMW 3 Series over its primary rivals in the compact  luxury car segment was an easy decision, especially if you enjoy the act of  driving. Today, the 3 Series still adheres to the qualities that made it  popular in the first place and remains a rewarding choice for enthusiasts, but  it's no longer the only game in town. In addition, many alternatives to this  BMW offer appealing traits unavailable in a 3 Series, like an electric drive  system, a wagon body style, and more value for the money.;Last  year, the seventh-generation 3 Series received its midlife updates right on  schedule, and a redesign is rumored to arrive for the 2026 model year. So,  expect few, if any, changes to the 2024 BMW 3 Series. It continues with  turbocharged four- and six-cylinder gas engines and a turbocharged plug-in  hybrid powertrain, each paired with rear-wheel drive or BMW's xDrive  all-wheel-drive system. The high-performance M3 remains in the lineup but is  reviewed separately.;If  we sound lukewarm about the 2024 3 Series, know that we still enjoy getting  behind its steering wheel, firing up its engine, and seeking out fun roads to  explore. But this BMW faces more capable competitors than ever, which dilutes  its appeal. For additional perspective on the 3 Series check out the Edmunds  testing team's full Expert Rating of the car.;BMW  hasn't released official information on the 2024 3 Series as of this writing.  We'll update our recommendation if anything changes, but based on last year's 3  Series, we recommend the 330e plug-in hybrid version. It doesn't cost much more than a base 330i, but it  provides an estimated 22 miles of electric driving before switching to hybrid  operation. Better yet, there is no penalty in terms of performance.;[Editor's note: The following  unofficial information is based on last year's 3 Series.

  "Review": "The  BMW M3 has garnered quite a reputation in the sports car world. For almost 40  years, the M3 name has been synonymous with power and performance. The  performance variant of the 3 Series consistently dominates the luxury sport  sedan segment. Unlike most of its competition, the M3 leans more toward  performance and less toward comfort. But it still offers plenty of luxury. An  enthusiast-preferred six-speed manual transmission routes 473 horsepower to the  rear wheels in the base M3. But if you want an automatic transmission, go for  the 503-hp M3 Competition, which is available in rear- or all-wheel drive. For 2024,  there's a new model for those looking for the most the M3 has to offer. ;The  M3 CS is a new limited-production, track-focused version of the M3. It's the  most powerful M3, producing 543 hp, and the lightest thanks to lightweight  components that save 75 pounds. It shares many upgrades with its fellow track  monster, the two-door M4 CSL, but keeps its rear seats and adds all-wheel drive  for improved acceleration. A titanium muffler, upgraded brakes and lighter  forged wheels with sticky high-performance tires (superior Michelin Pilot Sport  Cup 2 tires are a no-cost option) are just some of the go-fast parts BMW threw  at the M3 CS. The highly capable sedan also boasts an adaptive suspension,  stability control and steering that's been configured for track use. ;As  impressive as the M3 is, its styling and somewhat stiff ride aren't for  everyone. Also, the luxury sport sedan segment is packed with many talented  alternatives, including the all-new Mercedes-Benz AMG C 63 S E-Performance  plug-in hybrid, the stylish and comfortable Audi RS 5 and the Italian option:  the superb Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. The Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing is  another often overlooked but similarly worthy rival. For our test team's take  on the BMW M3, check out the Expert Rating below.;[Editor's note: The following  unofficial information is based on last year's M3. We expect the 2024 model  will have a similar lineup and we'll update this section once we have complete  information.] The  BMW M3 is available in four trim levels: the base M3, the M3 Competition and  the M3 Competition xDrive. For 2024,  the new track-specced M3 CS is also  available in limited numbers.

  "Review": "BMW's  latest vertical grille styling really puts the \"don't judge a book by its  cover\" adage to the test, but it also reinforces that notion if you can  get past the front end on the 2022 BMW M3, climb in, and give it a go. BMW's  storied M3 still delivers the kind of power, handling and overall performance  that makes it deserving of the M badge and also provides all the latest  technology in a convenient and luxurious sedan.;New  for 2022 is the addition of BMW's xDrive all-wheel-drive system, marking the  very first time AWD is offered in the M3's three-decade-plus history. It's only  available in the top Competition model, and only with an eight-speed automatic,  but it promises to quicken acceleration while giving drivers an added advantage  when cornering. Even better, if you feel the need to lay down some big smoky  drifts, you can switch to a rear-drive-only mode intended for track use only  (wink wink).;The  xDrive addition, along with a redesign last year, keeps the 2022 BMW M3 at the  top of an elite list of high-performance luxury sedans. Rivals include the  Mercedes-Benz AMG C 63, Audi RS5 Sportback, Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio and  Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing. We're confident you'll agree the M3 is the best, but  it can't hurt to test-drive all of them for, you know, \"research.\";The  2022 BMW M3 is available in three trim levels: the base M3, the M3 Competition and  the M3 Competition xDrive. All three  use a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder. It produces 473  horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque in the standard model and 503 hp and 479  lb-ft of torque in the M3 Competition and Competition xDrive. Rear-wheel-drive  is standard, and all-wheel drive (xDrive) is a new feature for the Competition  model only. A six-speed manual transmission is standard in the base M3 sedan.  An eight-speed automatic is optional on the base model and the only available  transmission on the Competition or Competition xDrive. Feature highlights  include:;M3 Coupe nComes  loaded with:;The  M3 also comes with:;A  handful of options are available on the M3. Notable picks include:;Competition n  Standard  features on the M3 Competition mirror those on the standard car. Besides a bump  in power, the M3 Competition includes:;Competition xDrive;Additionally,  the M3 Competition is available with one extra package:;",
  "Pros": "Explosive acceleration;Athletic handling, with lots of available driver-set adjustments;Respectably sized back seat and trunk;",
  "Cons": "Mediocre steering feel saps some fun from the driving experience;Excessive wind noise;Front-end styling is hard to love;",
  "What's new": "All-wheel drive is available for the M3 Competition model;Based on the seventh 3 Series generation introduced for 2019;",

  "Review": "BMW's  latest vertical grille styling really puts the \"don't judge a book by its  cover\" adage to the test, but it also reinforces that notion if you can  get past the front end on the 2022 BMW M3, climb in, and give it a go.

  "Review": "Fresh off a redesign last year, the BMW 3  Series continues to provide one of the best combinations of comfort,  performance and prestige you'll find among small luxury sport sedans. This new  seventh-generation model is 3 inches longer and 1.5 inches wider than before,  but it remains as agile and steady in the fast curves as ever. ;Keys to its charms are a larger, stiffer  chassis, and retuned suspension and steering, which tighten up the 3 Series'  already considerable handling performance. A turbocharged four-cylinder engine,  carried over from the previous model, gains slightly more horsepower and  increased low-end torque. And for 2020, a six-cylinder engine option returns in  the form of the new M340i. ;It's no ordinary six-cylinder either. The  M340i pumps out a stout 382 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque, which was M3 territory  just a few years ago. We assume the forthcoming redesigned M3 will add another  100 hp to that total, but for now the M340i serves as an appealing substitute.  The only downside is that you can't get a manual transmission anymore.;Even with its power and athleticism, the  3 Series is still a sensible sedan. The new model maintains the 3 Series'  hallmarks of interior comfort and quality. You'll find sporty and form-fitting  seats, impressive touchscreen displays and infotainment, and finer details such  as ambient cabin lighting and oak, maple and aluminum accents. A large trunk,  combined with 40\/20\/40-split folding rear seats and a hands-free opening  trunklid, also offers excellent utility, ;If there's any complaint about the 3  Series, it may be that its competence overwhelms exhilaration. Its Audi A4\/S4  rival feels more modern with a tech-oriented flair, and its primary Mercedes  competitor leans more into luxury than performance. Newer competitors, such as  the Alfa Romeo Giulia and the Genesis G70, offer drivers something a little  different, including the increasingly rare manual transmission. ;The  2020 BMW 3 Series is a five-passenger compact luxury sport sedan available in  two trim levels: the 330i and M340i. ;The 330i comes standard with a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (255 horsepower, 295 lb-ft of  torque), an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel  drive (known as xDrive) is optional. ;Standard  features include 18-inch wheels, automatic wipers, a sunroof, simulated leather  upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, power-adjustable front seats, an 8.8-inch touchscreen display, a  navigation system, Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, two USB inputs and a 10-speaker  audio system.;Forward  collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and  BMW Assist emergency communications are among the driver assistance features  that come standard. ;More  power is available with the M340i,  which comes standard with a six-cylinder engine (382 hp, 369 lb-ft), an  eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is  optional. ;Standard  features for the M340i are similar to the 330i's but also include sport-tuned  brakes and suspension, a 10.25-inch touchscreen display, and a digital gauge  cluster display (called Live Cockpit Professional).&nbsp; BMW's Connected Package Professional, which  combines remote and concierge services with real-time traffic information, is  also included. ;Both  trim levels offer several stand-alone options and a handful of option packages,  the most notable being the Premium and Executive packages. The Premium package  adds heated front seats, a heated steering wheel and a head-up display. The  Executive package adds upgraded adaptive LED headlights, surround and  bird's-eye parking camera views, parking sensors, an automated self-parking  system, and gesture control functions for the infotainment system. ;Additional  safety can be had by way of the Driving Assistance and Driving Assistance  Professional packages. The former adds blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert to the standard set of driver aids, while the latter equips  adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, active front cross-traffic alert,  and Traffic Jam Assist, a semi-automated steering system. For enhanced  performance, BMW offers a package that bundles high-performance tires and  improved engine cooling.;Some  of the above features are available as stand-alone options. Other individual  items include 19-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension, leather upholstery,  hands-free trunk opening, ambient cabin lighting, wireless device charging, a  Wi-Fi hotspot, and a premium Harman Kardon audio system.;",

  "Review": "Fresh off a redesign last year, the BMW 3  Series continues to provide one of the best combinations of comfort,  performance and prestige you'll find among small luxury sport sedans. This new  seventh-generation model is 3 inches longer and 1.5 inches wider than before,  but it remains as agile and steady in the fast curves as ever. ;Keys to its charms are a larger, stiffer  chassis, and retuned suspension and steering, which tighten up the 3 Series'  already considerable handling performance. A turbocharged four-cylinder engine,  carried over from the previous model, gains slightly more horsepower and  increased low-end torque. And for 2020, a six-cylinder engine option returns in  the form of the new M340i. ;It's no ordinary six-cylinder either. The  M340i pumps out a stout 382 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque, which was M3 territory  just a few years ago. We assume the forthcoming redesigned M3 will add another  100 hp to that total, but for now the M340i serves as an appealing substitute.  The only downside is that you can't get a manual transmission anymore.;Even with its power and athleticism, the  3 Series is still a sensible sedan. The new model maintains the 3 Series'  hallmarks of interior comfort and quality. You'll find sporty and form-fitting  seats, impressive touchscreen displays and infotainment, and finer details such  as ambient cabin lighting and oak, maple and aluminum accents. A large trunk,  combined with 40\/20\/40-split folding rear seats and a hands-free opening  trunklid, also offers excellent utility, ;If there's any complaint about the 3  Series, it may be that its competence overwhelms exhilaration. Its Audi A4\/S4  rival feels more modern with a tech-oriented flair, and its primary Mercedes  competitor leans more into luxury than performance. Newer competitors, such as  the Alfa Romeo Giulia and the Genesis G70, offer drivers something a little  different, including the increasingly rare manual transmission. ;The  2020 BMW 3 Series is a five-passenger compact luxury sport sedan available in  two trim levels: the 330i and M340i. ;The 330i comes standard with a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (255 horsepower, 295 lb-ft of  torque), an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel  drive (known as xDrive) is optional. ;Standard  features include 18-inch wheels, automatic wipers, a sunroof, simulated leather  upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, power-adjustable front seats, an 8.8-inch touchscreen display, a  navigation system, Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, two USB inputs and a 10-speaker  audio system.;Forward  collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and  BMW Assist emergency communications are among the driver assistance features  that come standard. ;More  power is available with the M340i,  which comes standard with a six-cylinder engine (382 hp, 369 lb-ft), an  eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is  optional. ;Standard  features for the M340i are similar to the 330i's but also include sport-tuned  brakes and suspension, a 10.25-inch touchscreen display, and a digital gauge  cluster display (called Live Cockpit Professional).&nbsp; BMW's Connected Package Professional, which  combines remote and concierge services with real-time traffic information, is  also included. ;Both  trim levels offer several stand-alone options and a handful of option packages,  the most notable being the Premium and Executive packages. The Premium package  adds heated front seats, a heated steering wheel and a head-up display. The  Executive package adds upgraded adaptive LED headlights, surround and  bird's-eye parking camera views, parking sensors, an automated self-parking  system, and gesture control functions for the infotainment system. ;Additional  safety can be had by way of the Driving Assistance and Driving Assistance  Professional packages. The former adds blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert to the standard set of driver aids, while the latter equips  adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, active front cross-traffic alert,  and Traffic Jam Assist, a semi-automated steering system. For enhanced  performance, BMW offers a package that bundles high-performance tires and  improved engine cooling.;Some  of the above features are available as stand-alone options. Other individual  items include 19-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension, leather upholstery,  hands-free trunk opening, ambient cabin lighting, wireless device charging, a  Wi-Fi hotspot, and a premium Harman Kardon audio system.;",

  "Review": "Fresh off a redesign last year, the BMW 3  Series continues to provide one of the best combinations of comfort,  performance and prestige you'll find among small luxury sport sedans. This new  seventh-generation model is 3 inches longer and 1.5 inches wider than before,  but it remains as agile and steady in the fast curves as ever. ;Keys to its charms are a larger, stiffer  chassis, and retuned suspension and steering, which tighten up the 3 Series'  already considerable handling performance. A turbocharged four-cylinder engine,  carried over from the previous model, gains slightly more horsepower and  increased low-end torque. And for 2020, a six-cylinder engine option returns in  the form of the new M340i. ;It's no ordinary six-cylinder either. The  M340i pumps out a stout 382 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque, which was M3 territory  just a few years ago. We assume the forthcoming redesigned M3 will add another  100 hp to that total, but for now the M340i serves as an appealing substitute.  The only downside is that you can't get a manual transmission anymore.;Even with its power and athleticism, the  3 Series is still a sensible sedan. The new model maintains the 3 Series'  hallmarks of interior comfort and quality. You'll find sporty and form-fitting  seats, impressive touchscreen displays and infotainment, and finer details such  as ambient cabin lighting and oak, maple and aluminum accents. A large trunk,  combined with 40\/20\/40-split folding rear seats and a hands-free opening  trunklid, also offers excellent utility, ;If there's any complaint about the 3  Series, it may be that its competence overwhelms exhilaration. Its Audi A4\/S4  rival feels more modern with a tech-oriented flair, and its primary Mercedes  competitor leans more into luxury than performance. Newer competitors, such as  the Alfa Romeo Giulia and the Genesis G70, offer drivers something a little  different, including the increasingly rare manual transmission. ;The  2020 BMW 3 Series is a five-passenger compact luxury sport sedan available in  two trim levels: the 330i and M340i. ;The 330i comes standard with a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (255 horsepower, 295 lb-ft of  torque), an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel  drive (known as xDrive) is optional. ;Standard  features include 18-inch wheels, automatic wipers, a sunroof, simulated leather  upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview  mirror, power-adjustable front seats, an 8.8-inch touchscreen display, a  navigation system, Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, two USB inputs and a 10-speaker  audio system.;Forward  collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and  BMW Assist emergency communications are among the driver assistance features  that come standard. ;More  power is available with the M340i,  which comes standard with a six-cylinder engine (382 hp, 369 lb-ft), an  eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is  optional. ;Standard  features for the M340i are similar to the 330i's but also include sport-tuned  brakes and suspension, a 10.25-inch touchscreen display, and a digital gauge  cluster display (called Live Cockpit Professional).&nbsp; BMW's Connected Package Professional, which  combines remote and concierge services with real-time traffic information, is  also included. ;Both  trim levels offer several stand-alone options and a handful of option packages,  the most notable being the Premium and Executive packages. The Premium package  adds heated front seats, a heated steering wheel and a head-up display. The  Executive package adds upgraded adaptive LED headlights, surround and  bird's-eye parking camera views, parking sensors, an automated self-parking  system, and gesture control functions for the infotainment system. ;Additional  safety can be had by way of the Driving Assistance and Driving Assistance  Professional packages. The former adds blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alert to the standard set of driver aids, while the latter equips  adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, active front cross-traffic alert,  and Traffic Jam Assist, a semi-automated steering system. For enhanced  performance, BMW offers a package that bundles high-performance tires and  improved engine cooling.;Some  of the above features are available as stand-alone options. Other individual  items include 19-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension, leather upholstery,  hands-free trunk opening, ambient cabin lighting, wireless device charging, a  Wi-Fi hotspot, and a premium Harman Kardon audio system.;",

  "Review": "Few vehicles have consistently dominated their segment time and time again like the Ford F-150 has. The success of Ford's light-duty pickup truck is partly due to the almost endless configurations it offers. Whether you're looking for an affordable work truck, luxury cruiser or capable off-roader, the F-150 has you covered. It offers a wide range of engines, from a base V6 to a powerful hybrid powertrain. You have a choice of several cab and bed sizes and an incredible number of features to choose from including the Pro Power Onboard system that can supply juice to various electronics. And for 2024, the F-150 looks to be even better thanks to the most significant update since this latest-generation truck debuted for the 2021 model year.;You can spot the updated F-150 from its mildly updated grille and headlights. But more important is what's inside. All F-150s now get a full digital gauge cluster and a 12-inch central touchscreen display as standard. Other tech improvements encompass an update to BlueCruise, Ford's hands-free driving assistance system, to make it more useful and helpful in highway traffic. Under the hood, the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 now serves as the truck's base engine. Also, the Raptor R's supercharged 5.2-liter V8 gets a boost in power, and the price for the optional PowerBoost hybrid has been reduced to be the same as the optional turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. Finally, there's a new optional tailgate that opens in additional ways to make cargo loading easier. ;The changes made for 2024 help keep the F-150 at the top of its game and ensure it stays at the top of our truck rankings. But if you're still undecided on what truck to get, check out the Ram 1500. It's currently the F-150's most competitive rival and is the smoothest-riding pickup. The recently redesigned Toyota Tundra is also worth a look, and the F-150's longtime archenemy, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, has a lot to offer. To get our test team's in-depth review of the Ford F-150, check out the Edmunds Expert Rating below. ;We bought a 2021 Ford F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid for long-term testing. It's not a 2024 model, but our observations still apply because it belongs to the same F-150 generation. To find out what we think about its fuel economy, technology, comfort and more, check out our F-150 Hybrid long-term review here.;While there's an F-150 configuration to match pretty much anybody's budget or desire, we suggest checking out the XLT trim for all-around value. For higher budgets, we think the hybrid powertrain is worth getting because of the long-term gas savings. More generally, we recommend getting an F-150 with Ford's BlueCruise hands-free system if you do a lot of highway driving and Pro Power Onboard if you use your F-150 a lot for recreation or job sites. ;The 2024 Ford F-150 is offered in six primary trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, Platinum and King Ranch. There are also the off-road-oriented Tremor, Raptor and Raptor R versions that exist outside the traditional lineup. There are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths depending on cab style. Along with the many trim levels and cab styles, the F-150 offers six available powertrains. All are paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Keep reading for our breakdown of the F-150's powertrains and each trim's significant standard and optional features.;The engine lineup includes:;(Note: The all-electric F-150 Lightning is reviewed separately.) ;XLn  Standard features on this base trim level include:;Driver assist features on the XL include: ;STXn  The STX is equipped similarly to the XL but has 20-inch wheels and carpeted flooring. It also has greater availability of optional features than the XL.;XLT n  Adds to the XL with:;Lariat n  Gets you more premium features such as: ;Platinumn  Upgrades over the Lariat with:;King Ranch n  Similar to the Platinum but also has:;Tremorn  The off-road-oriented Tremor is only available as a crew cab with the 5.5-foot bed. It essentially starts with XLT content and adds: ;Raptorn  The off-road-oriented Raptor includes a higher-output turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine, 4WD with low-range gearing and more. Broadly, it combines many of the luxury-oriented features from the King Ranch with the off-road features of the Tremor, plus: ;Raptor R n  The Raptor R swaps the Raptor's turbocharged V6 for a much more potent supercharged V8. It also comes standard with 37-inch tires that are otherwise an option on the regular Raptor. ;As you'd probably expect of a full-size pickup, the F-150 is available with all sorts of options. Most lower trim levels can be fitted with options that come standard on higher trims. Other significant options to look out for are:;",

  "Review": "Few vehicles have consistently dominated their segment time and time again like the Ford F-150 has. The success of Ford's light-duty pickup truck is partly due to the almost endless configurations it offers. Whether you're looking for an affordable work truck, luxury cruiser or capable off-roader, the F-150 has you covered. It offers a wide range of engines, from a base V6 to a powerful hybrid powertrain. You have a choice of several cab and bed sizes and an incredible number of features to choose from including the Pro Power Onboard system that can supply juice to various electronics. And for 2024, the F-150 looks to be even better thanks to the most significant update since this latest-generation truck debuted for the 2021 model year.;You can spot the updated F-150 from its mildly updated grille and headlights. But more important is what's inside. All F-150s now get a full digital gauge cluster and a 12-inch central touchscreen display as standard. Other tech improvements encompass an update to BlueCruise, Ford's hands-free driving assistance system, to make it more useful and helpful in highway traffic. Under the hood, the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 now serves as the truck's base engine. Also, the Raptor R's supercharged 5.2-liter V8 gets a boost in power, and the price for the optional PowerBoost hybrid has been reduced to be the same as the optional turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. Finally, there's a new optional tailgate that opens in additional ways to make cargo loading easier. ;The changes made for 2024 help keep the F-150 at the top of its game and ensure it stays at the top of our truck rankings. But if you're still undecided on what truck to get, check out the Ram 1500. It's currently the F-150's most competitive rival and is the smoothest-riding pickup. The recently redesigned Toyota Tundra is also worth a look, and the F-150's longtime archenemy, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, has a lot to offer. To get our test team's in-depth review of the Ford F-150, check out the Edmunds Expert Rating below. ;We bought a 2021 Ford F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid for long-term testing. It's not a 2024 model, but our observations still apply because it belongs to the same F-150 generation. To find out what we think about its fuel economy, technology, comfort and more, check out our F-150 Hybrid long-term review here.;While there's an F-150 configuration to match pretty much anybody's budget or desire, we suggest checking out the XLT trim for all-around value. For higher budgets, we think the hybrid powertrain is worth getting because of the long-term gas savings. More generally, we recommend getting an F-150 with Ford's BlueCruise hands-free system if you do a lot of highway driving and Pro Power Onboard if you use your F-150 a lot for recreation or job sites. ;The 2024 Ford F-150 is offered in six primary trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, Platinum and King Ranch. There are also the off-road-oriented Tremor, Raptor and Raptor R versions that exist outside the traditional lineup. There are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths depending on cab style.

The recently redesigned Toyota Tundra is also worth a look, and the F-150's longtime archenemy, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, has a lot to offer. To get our test team's in-depth review of the Ford F-150, check out the Edmunds Expert Rating below. ;We bought a 2021 Ford F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid for long-term testing. It's not a 2024 model, but our observations still apply because it belongs to the same F-150 generation. To find out what we think about its fuel economy, technology, comfort and more, check out our F-150 Hybrid long-term review here.;While there's an F-150 configuration to match pretty much anybody's budget or desire, we suggest checking out the XLT trim for all-around value. For higher budgets, we think the hybrid powertrain is worth getting because of the long-term gas savings. More generally, we recommend getting an F-150 with Ford's BlueCruise hands-free system if you do a lot of highway driving and Pro Power Onboard if you use your F-150 a lot for recreation or job sites. ;The 2024 Ford F-150 is offered in six primary trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, Platinum and King Ranch. There are also the off-road-oriented Tremor, Raptor and Raptor R versions that exist outside the traditional lineup. There are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths depending on cab style. Along with the many trim levels and cab styles, the F-150 offers six available powertrains. All are paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission.

  "Review": "Few vehicles have consistently dominated their segment time and time again like the Ford F-150 has. The success of Ford's light-duty pickup truck is partly due to the almost endless configurations it offers. Whether you're looking for an affordable work truck, luxury cruiser or capable off-roader, the F-150 has you covered. It offers a wide range of engines, from a base V6 to a powerful hybrid powertrain. You have a choice of several cab and bed sizes and an incredible number of features to choose from including the Pro Power Onboard system that can supply juice to various electronics. And for 2024, the F-150 looks to be even better thanks to the most significant update since this latest-generation truck debuted for the 2021 model year.;You can spot the updated F-150 from its mildly updated grille and headlights. But more important is what's inside. All F-150s now get a full digital gauge cluster and a 12-inch central touchscreen display as standard. Other tech improvements encompass an update to BlueCruise, Ford's hands-free driving assistance system, to make it more useful and helpful in highway traffic. Under the hood, the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 now serves as the truck's base engine. Also, the Raptor R's supercharged 5.2-liter V8 gets a boost in power, and the price for the optional PowerBoost hybrid has been reduced to be the same as the optional turbocharged 3.5-liter V6.

  "Review": "Few vehicles have consistently dominated their segment time and time again like the Ford F-150 has. The success of Ford's light-duty pickup truck is partly due to the almost endless configurations it offers. Whether you're looking for an affordable work truck, luxury cruiser or capable off-roader, the F-150 has you covered. It offers a wide range of engines, from a base V6 to a powerful hybrid powertrain. You have a choice of several cab and bed sizes and an incredible number of features to choose from including the Pro Power Onboard system that can supply juice to various electronics. And for 2024, the F-150 looks to be even better thanks to the most significant update since this latest-generation truck debuted for the 2021 model year.;You can spot the updated F-150 from its mildly updated grille and headlights. But more important is what's inside. All F-150s now get a full digital gauge cluster and a 12-inch central touchscreen display as standard. Other tech improvements encompass an update to BlueCruise, Ford's hands-free driving assistance system, to make it more useful and helpful in highway traffic. Under the hood, the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 now serves as the truck's base engine. Also, the Raptor R's supercharged 5.2-liter V8 gets a boost in power, and the price for the optional PowerBoost hybrid has been reduced to be the same as the optional turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. Finally, there's a new optional tailgate that opens in additional ways to make cargo loading easier. ;The changes made for 2024 help keep the F-150 at the top of its game and ensure it stays at the top of our truck rankings. But if you're still undecided on what truck to get, check out the Ram 1500. It's currently the F-150's most competitive rival and is the smoothest-riding pickup. The recently redesigned Toyota Tundra is also worth a look, and the F-150's longtime archenemy, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, has a lot to offer. To get our test team's in-depth review of the Ford F-150, check out the Edmunds Expert Rating below. ;We bought a 2021 Ford F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid for long-term testing. It's not a 2024 model, but our observations still apply because it belongs to the same F-150 generation. To find out what we think about its fuel economy, technology, comfort and more, check out our F-150 Hybrid long-term review here.;While there's an F-150 configuration to match pretty much anybody's budget or desire, we suggest checking out the XLT trim for all-around value. For higher budgets, we think the hybrid powertrain is worth getting because of the long-term gas savings. More generally, we recommend getting an F-150 with Ford's BlueCruise hands-free system if you do a lot of highway driving and Pro Power Onboard if you use your F-150 a lot for recreation or job sites. ;The 2024 Ford F-150 is offered in six primary trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, Platinum and King Ranch. There are also the off-road-oriented Tremor, Raptor and Raptor R versions that exist outside the traditional lineup. There are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths depending on cab style. Along with the many trim levels and cab styles, the F-150 offers six available powertrains. All are paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Keep reading for our breakdown of the F-150's powertrains and each trim's significant standard and optional features.;The engine lineup includes:;(Note: The all-electric F-150 Lightning is reviewed separately.) ;XLn  Standard features on this base trim level include:;Driver assist features on the XL include: ;STXn  The STX is equipped similarly to the XL but has 20-inch wheels and carpeted flooring.

It essentially starts with XLT content and adds: ;Raptorn  The off-road-oriented Raptor includes a higher-output turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine, 4WD with low-range gearing and more. Broadly, it combines many of the luxury-oriented features from the King Ranch with the off-road features of the Tremor, plus: ;Raptor R n  The Raptor R swaps the Raptor's turbocharged V6 for a much more potent supercharged V8. It also comes standard with 37-inch tires that are otherwise an option on the regular Raptor. ;As you'd probably expect of a full-size pickup, the F-150 is available with all sorts of options. Most lower trim levels can be fitted with options that come standard on higher trims. Other significant options to look out for are:;",

  "Review": "Few vehicles have consistently dominated their segment time and time again like the Ford F-150 has. The success of Ford's light-duty pickup truck is partly due to the almost endless configurations it offers. Whether you're looking for an affordable work truck, luxury cruiser or capable off-roader, the F-150 has you covered. It offers a wide range of engines, from a base V6 to a powerful hybrid powertrain. You have a choice of several cab and bed sizes and an incredible number of features to choose from including the Pro Power Onboard system that can supply juice to various electronics. And for 2024, the F-150 looks to be even better thanks to the most significant update since this latest-generation truck debuted for the 2021 model year.;You can spot the updated F-150 from its mildly updated grille and headlights. But more important is what's inside. All F-150s now get a full digital gauge cluster and a 12-inch central touchscreen display as standard. Other tech improvements encompass an update to BlueCruise, Ford's hands-free driving assistance system, to make it more useful and helpful in highway traffic. Under the hood, the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 now serves as the truck's base engine. Also, the Raptor R's supercharged 5.2-liter V8 gets a boost in power, and the price for the optional PowerBoost hybrid has been reduced to be the same as the optional turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. Finally, there's a new optional tailgate that opens in additional ways to make cargo loading easier. ;The changes made for 2024 help keep the F-150 at the top of its game and ensure it stays at the top of our truck rankings. But if you're still undecided on what truck to get, check out the Ram 1500. It's currently the F-150's most competitive rival and is the smoothest-riding pickup. The recently redesigned Toyota Tundra is also worth a look, and the F-150's longtime archenemy, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, has a lot to offer. To get our test team's in-depth review of the Ford F-150, check out the Edmunds Expert Rating below. ;We bought a 2021 Ford F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid for long-term testing. It's not a 2024 model, but our observations still apply because it belongs to the same F-150 generation. To find out what we think about its fuel economy, technology, comfort and more, check out our F-150 Hybrid long-term review here.;While there's an F-150 configuration to match pretty much anybody's budget or desire, we suggest checking out the XLT trim for all-around value. For higher budgets, we think the hybrid powertrain is worth getting because of the long-term gas savings. More generally, we recommend getting an F-150 with Ford's BlueCruise hands-free system if you do a lot of highway driving and Pro Power Onboard if you use your F-150 a lot for recreation or job sites. ;The 2024 Ford F-150 is offered in six primary trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, Platinum and King Ranch. There are also the off-road-oriented Tremor, Raptor and Raptor R versions that exist outside the traditional lineup. There are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths depending on cab style. Along with the many trim levels and cab styles, the F-150 offers six available powertrains. All are paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Keep reading for our breakdown of the F-150's powertrains and each trim's significant standard and optional features.;The engine lineup includes:;(Note: The all-electric F-150 Lightning is reviewed separately.) ;XLn  Standard features on this base trim level include:;Driver assist features on the XL include: ;STXn  The STX is equipped similarly to the XL but has 20-inch wheels and carpeted flooring.

It essentially starts with XLT content and adds: ;Raptorn  The off-road-oriented Raptor includes a higher-output turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine, 4WD with low-range gearing and more. Broadly, it combines many of the luxury-oriented features from the King Ranch with the off-road features of the Tremor, plus: ;Raptor R n  The Raptor R swaps the Raptor's turbocharged V6 for a much more potent supercharged V8. It also comes standard with 37-inch tires that are otherwise an option on the regular Raptor. ;As you'd probably expect of a full-size pickup, the F-150 is available with all sorts of options. Most lower trim levels can be fitted with options that come standard on higher trims. Other significant options to look out for are:;",

  "Review": "Few vehicles have consistently dominated their segment time and time again like the Ford F-150 has. The success of Ford's light-duty pickup truck is partly due to the almost endless configurations it offers. Whether you're looking for an affordable work truck, luxury cruiser or capable off-roader, the F-150 has you covered. It offers a wide range of engines, from a base V6 to a powerful hybrid powertrain. You have a choice of several cab and bed sizes and an incredible number of features to choose from including the Pro Power Onboard system that can supply juice to various electronics. And for 2024, the F-150 looks to be even better thanks to the most significant update since this latest-generation truck debuted for the 2021 model year.;You can spot the updated F-150 from its mildly updated grille and headlights. But more important is what's inside. All F-150s now get a full digital gauge cluster and a 12-inch central touchscreen display as standard. Other tech improvements encompass an update to BlueCruise, Ford's hands-free driving assistance system, to make it more useful and helpful in highway traffic. Under the hood, the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 now serves as the truck's base engine. Also, the Raptor R's supercharged 5.2-liter V8 gets a boost in power, and the price for the optional PowerBoost hybrid has been reduced to be the same as the optional turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. Finally, there's a new optional tailgate that opens in additional ways to make cargo loading easier. ;The changes made for 2024 help keep the F-150 at the top of its game and ensure it stays at the top of our truck rankings. But if you're still undecided on what truck to get, check out the Ram 1500. It's currently the F-150's most competitive rival and is the smoothest-riding pickup. The recently redesigned Toyota Tundra is also worth a look, and the F-150's longtime archenemy, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, has a lot to offer. To get our test team's in-depth review of the Ford F-150, check out the Edmunds Expert Rating below. ;We bought a 2021 Ford F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid for long-term testing. It's not a 2024 model, but our observations still apply because it belongs to the same F-150 generation. To find out what we think about its fuel economy, technology, comfort and more, check out our F-150 Hybrid long-term review here.;While there's an F-150 configuration to match pretty much anybody's budget or desire, we suggest checking out the XLT trim for all-around value. For higher budgets, we think the hybrid powertrain is worth getting because of the long-term gas savings. More generally, we recommend getting an F-150 with Ford's BlueCruise hands-free system if you do a lot of highway driving and Pro Power Onboard if you use your F-150 a lot for recreation or job sites. ;The 2024 Ford F-150 is offered in six primary trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, Platinum and King Ranch. There are also the off-road-oriented Tremor, Raptor and Raptor R versions that exist outside the traditional lineup. There are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths depending on cab style. Along with the many trim levels and cab styles, the F-150 offers six available powertrains. All are paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Keep reading for our breakdown of the F-150's powertrains and each trim's significant standard and optional features.;The engine lineup includes:;(Note: The all-electric F-150 Lightning is reviewed separately.) ;XLn  Standard features on this base trim level include:;Driver assist features on the XL include: ;STXn  The STX is equipped similarly to the XL but has 20-inch wheels and carpeted flooring.

It essentially starts with XLT content and adds: ;Raptorn  The off-road-oriented Raptor includes a higher-output turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine, 4WD with low-range gearing and more. Broadly, it combines many of the luxury-oriented features from the King Ranch with the off-road features of the Tremor, plus: ;Raptor R n  The Raptor R swaps the Raptor's turbocharged V6 for a much more potent supercharged V8. It also comes standard with 37-inch tires that are otherwise an option on the regular Raptor. ;As you'd probably expect of a full-size pickup, the F-150 is available with all sorts of options. Most lower trim levels can be fitted with options that come standard on higher trims. Other significant options to look out for are:;",

  "Review": "Few vehicles have consistently dominated their segment time and time again like the Ford F-150 has. The success of Ford's light-duty pickup truck is partly due to the almost endless configurations it offers. Whether you're looking for an affordable work truck, luxury cruiser or capable off-roader, the F-150 has you covered. It offers a wide range of engines, from a base V6 to a powerful hybrid powertrain. You have a choice of several cab and bed sizes and an incredible number of features to choose from including the Pro Power Onboard system that can supply juice to various electronics. And for 2024, the F-150 looks to be even better thanks to the most significant update since this latest-generation truck debuted for the 2021 model year.;You can spot the updated F-150 from its mildly updated grille and headlights. But more important is what's inside. All F-150s now get a full digital gauge cluster and a 12-inch central touchscreen display as standard. Other tech improvements encompass an update to BlueCruise, Ford's hands-free driving assistance system, to make it more useful and helpful in highway traffic. Under the hood, the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 now serves as the truck's base engine. Also, the Raptor R's supercharged 5.2-liter V8 gets a boost in power, and the price for the optional PowerBoost hybrid has been reduced to be the same as the optional turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. Finally, there's a new optional tailgate that opens in additional ways to make cargo loading easier. ;The changes made for 2024 help keep the F-150 at the top of its game and ensure it stays at the top of our truck rankings. But if you're still undecided on what truck to get, check out the Ram 1500. It's currently the F-150's most competitive rival and is the smoothest-riding pickup. The recently redesigned Toyota Tundra is also worth a look, and the F-150's longtime archenemy, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, has a lot to offer. To get our test team's in-depth review of the Ford F-150, check out the Edmunds Expert Rating below. ;We bought a 2021 Ford F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid for long-term testing. It's not a 2024 model, but our observations still apply because it belongs to the same F-150 generation. To find out what we think about its fuel economy, technology, comfort and more, check out our F-150 Hybrid long-term review here.;While there's an F-150 configuration to match pretty much anybody's budget or desire, we suggest checking out the XLT trim for all-around value. For higher budgets, we think the hybrid powertrain is worth getting because of the long-term gas savings. More generally, we recommend getting an F-150 with Ford's BlueCruise hands-free system if you do a lot of highway driving and Pro Power Onboard if you use your F-150 a lot for recreation or job sites. ;The 2024 Ford F-150 is offered in six primary trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, Platinum and King Ranch. There are also the off-road-oriented Tremor, Raptor and Raptor R versions that exist outside the traditional lineup. There are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths depending on cab style. Along with the many trim levels and cab styles, the F-150 offers six available powertrains. All are paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Keep reading for our breakdown of the F-150's powertrains and each trim's significant standard and optional features.;The engine lineup includes:;(Note: The all-electric F-150 Lightning is reviewed separately.) ;XLn  Standard features on this base trim level include:;Driver assist features on the XL include: ;STXn  The STX is equipped similarly to the XL but has 20-inch wheels and carpeted flooring.

It essentially starts with XLT content and adds: ;Raptorn  The off-road-oriented Raptor includes a higher-output turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine, 4WD with low-range gearing and more. Broadly, it combines many of the luxury-oriented features from the King Ranch with the off-road features of the Tremor, plus: ;Raptor R n  The Raptor R swaps the Raptor's turbocharged V6 for a much more potent supercharged V8. It also comes standard with 37-inch tires that are otherwise an option on the regular Raptor. ;As you'd probably expect of a full-size pickup, the F-150 is available with all sorts of options.

More generally, we recommend getting an F-150 with Ford's BlueCruise hands-free system if you do a lot of highway driving and Pro Power Onboard if you use your F-150 a lot for recreation or job sites. ;The 2024 Ford F-150 is offered in six primary trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, Platinum and King Ranch. There are also the off-road-oriented Tremor, Raptor and Raptor R versions that exist outside the traditional lineup. There are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths depending on cab style. Along with the many trim levels and cab styles, the F-150 offers six available powertrains. All are paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Keep reading for our breakdown of the F-150's powertrains and each trim's significant standard and optional features.;The engine lineup includes:;(Note: The all-electric F-150 Lightning is reviewed separately.) ;XLn  Standard features on this base trim level include:;Driver assist features on the XL include: ;STXn  The STX is equipped similarly to the XL but has 20-inch wheels and carpeted flooring.

  "Review": "Few vehicles have consistently dominated their segment time and time again like the Ford F-150 has. The success of Ford's light-duty pickup truck is partly due to the almost endless configurations it offers. Whether you're looking for an affordable work truck, luxury cruiser or capable off-roader, the F-150 has you covered. It offers a wide range of engines, from a base V6 to a powerful hybrid powertrain. You have a choice of several cab and bed sizes and an incredible number of features to choose from including the Pro Power Onboard system that can supply juice to various electronics. And for 2024, the F-150 looks to be even better thanks to the most significant update since this latest-generation truck debuted for the 2021 model year.;You can spot the updated F-150 from its mildly updated grille and headlights. But more important is what's inside. All F-150s now get a full digital gauge cluster and a 12-inch central touchscreen display as standard. Other tech improvements encompass an update to BlueCruise, Ford's hands-free driving assistance system, to make it more useful and helpful in highway traffic. Under the hood, the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 now serves as the truck's base engine. Also, the Raptor R's supercharged 5.2-liter V8 gets a boost in power, and the price for the optional PowerBoost hybrid has been reduced to be the same as the optional turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. Finally, there's a new optional tailgate that opens in additional ways to make cargo loading easier. ;The changes made for 2024 help keep the F-150 at the top of its game and ensure it stays at the top of our truck rankings. But if you're still undecided on what truck to get, check out the Ram 1500. It's currently the F-150's most competitive rival and is the smoothest-riding pickup. The recently redesigned Toyota Tundra is also worth a look, and the F-150's longtime archenemy, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, has a lot to offer. To get our test team's in-depth review of the Ford F-150, check out the Edmunds Expert Rating below. ;We bought a 2021 Ford F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid for long-term testing.

Finally, there's a new optional tailgate that opens in additional ways to make cargo loading easier. ;The changes made for 2024 help keep the F-150 at the top of its game and ensure it stays at the top of our truck rankings. But if you're still undecided on what truck to get, check out the Ram 1500. It's currently the F-150's most competitive rival and is the smoothest-riding pickup. The recently redesigned Toyota Tundra is also worth a look, and the F-150's longtime archenemy, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, has a lot to offer. To get our test team's in-depth review of the Ford F-150, check out the Edmunds Expert Rating below. ;We bought a 2021 Ford F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid for long-term testing. It's not a 2024 model, but our observations still apply because it belongs to the same F-150 generation. To find out what we think about its fuel economy, technology, comfort and more, check out our F-150 Hybrid long-term review here.;While there's an F-150 configuration to match pretty much anybody's budget or desire, we suggest checking out the XLT trim for all-around value. For higher budgets, we think the hybrid powertrain is worth getting because of the long-term gas savings. More generally, we recommend getting an F-150 with Ford's BlueCruise hands-free system if you do a lot of highway driving and Pro Power Onboard if you use your F-150 a lot for recreation or job sites. ;The 2024 Ford F-150 is offered in six primary trim levels: XL, STX, XLT, Lariat, Platinum and King Ranch. There are also the off-road-oriented Tremor, Raptor and Raptor R versions that exist outside the traditional lineup. There are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths depending on cab style. Along with the many trim levels and cab styles, the F-150 offers six available powertrains. All are paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission.

  "Review": "Few vehicles have consistently dominated their segment time and time again like the Ford F-150 has. The success of Ford's light-duty pickup truck is partly due to the almost endless configurations it offers. Whether you're looking for an affordable work truck, luxury cruiser or capable off-roader, the F-150 has you covered. It offers a wide range of engines, from a base V6 to a powerful hybrid powertrain. You have a choice of several cab and bed sizes and an incredible number of features to choose from including the Pro Power Onboard system that can supply juice to various electronics. And for 2024, the F-150 looks to be even better thanks to the most significant update since this latest-generation truck debuted for the 2021 model year.;You can spot the updated F-150 from its mildly updated grille and headlights. But more important is what's inside. All F-150s now get a full digital gauge cluster and a 12-inch central touchscreen display as standard. Other tech improvements encompass an update to BlueCruise, Ford's hands-free driving assistance system, to make it more useful and helpful in highway traffic. Under the hood, the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 now serves as the truck's base engine.

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",
  "Pros": "High towing and payload capacities are ideal for work or play;Comfort and safety tech runs the gamut from blue-collar basic to luxury living;Multiple engines deliver balance of power and fuel economy;Raptor model's gonzo off-road ability;",

  "What's new": "Advanced driving aids now grouped into packages, with some standard on Lariat and above models and others on the Limited model;New appearance packages for XL, XLT and Lariat trims;4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot is now standard;Part of the 13th F-150 generation introduced for 2015;",

And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",
  "Pros": "High towing and payload capacities are ideal for work or play;Comfort and safety tech runs the gamut from blue-collar basic to luxury living;Multiple engines deliver balance of power and fuel economy;Raptor model's gonzo off-road ability;",
  "Cons": "Ride can be rough with an unladen bed;Fell short of some fuel economy estimates in our real-world testing;",
  "What's new": "Advanced driving aids now grouped into packages, with some standard on Lariat and above models and others on the Limited model;New appearance packages for XL, XLT and Lariat trims;4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot is now standard;Part of the 13th F-150 generation introduced for 2015;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",

  "Review": "The  2020 Ford F-150 is a perfect example of the tough yet modern full-size pickup  truck. It has the guts to tow and haul at the top of its class, yet it also  offers a wide range of luxury and technology features. The combination makes it  one of the most versatile trucks available and justifies the F-Series as the  top-selling vehicle on the market.;A  lot of the F-150's appeal comes from its wide range of configurations. On basic  work trucks, the base 3.3-liter V6 is paired with a six-speed automatic  transmission. All other engines â€” including a fuel-efficient  turbodiesel, two turbocharged V6s and a tried-and-true V8 â€” are  equipped with a quick-shifting 10-speed. Depending on your needs, there are  versions that excel in towing, comfort, fuel economy or off-road performance.;Ford  has invested heavily to keep the F-150 updated with the times. In addition to  its lightweight all-aluminum body, the truck offers a selection of advanced  technologies. Standard on all models is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and most trim  levels come with the Sync 3 infotainment system and an 8-inch touchscreen.  Pre-collision assist with automatic braking is also standard equipment. New for  2020, the Ford Co-Pilot360 safety suite comes on the Lariat, King Ranch,  Platinum and Limited trims.;The  F-150 is a well-rounded truck with few compromises for a full-size pickup. But  it's been a while since this version first launched in 2014, and you should  note that competitors offer newer models. In particular, the Ram 1500 goes  above and beyond with its smoother ride quality and innovative storage areas.  The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra are also freshly redesigned. But if  you look to the F-150 for its advanced technology and user-friendliness, you  won't be disappointed. ;Notably, the 2020 Ford F-150 is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article.;The F-150 has been the truck sales leader  for decades, so every new F-150 is massively important. That's why we bought a  bright blue Lariat for our long-term fleet when this generation launched in  2015. While we liked the truck overall, we were unimpressed by the new  2.7-liter engine's real-world fuel economy compared to its EPA numbers. When  the 2018 model bowed with a new transmission, we decided to buy another F-150  in nearly the exact same configuration, in part to see if the fuel economy  improved. To read about how economy improved â€” or didn't â€”  read our long-term F-150 test,  where we also covered everything from performance to long-distance seat  comfort.;As  with most full-size pickups, there's a lot to choose from on the 2020 F-150,  starting with six main trim levels: the base XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum and Limited. Ford also offers the  off-road-ready Raptor variant. There  are three cab styles â€” regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew  (crew cab) â€” and three bed lengths, depending on cab style.;Across  the lineup, the F-150 has an engine to suit almost any shopper. The base  3.3-liter V6 is not to be overlooked since 290 horsepower is more than adequate  for many tasks. However, it works with an older six-speed automatic versus the  modern 10-speed that's otherwise standard. And with just 265 lb-ft of torque,  it's hardly a towing champ. ;Fortunately,  every other engine is a torque-monster in its own right, ranging from the  2.7-liter turbo V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft) to the non-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8  (395 hp, 400 lb-ft). An overachieving 3.5-liter turbo V6 is also available in  spicy (375 hp, 470 lb-ft) and extra-hot (450 hp, 510 lb-ft) flavors â€”  though you can only get the latter on the pricey Limited and Raptor trims.  Don't sleep on the turbocharged diesel V6, by the way, which drops to 250 hp  but delivers 440 lb-ft of torque down low â€” right where you need it.;Standard  features on the base XL trim level  include trailer sway control and pre-wired trailer connections, but you'll have  to make do with manual mirrors and windows, vinyl flooring and a four-speaker  stereo. The optional 101A package adds some power accessories and other  desirables such as Bluetooth and USB connectivity. But for the most part, the  XL is a bare-bones, no-nonsense truck. ;A  luxury-oriented side starts to shine through when stepping up through the  trims. The XLT adds alloy wheels,  chrome trim, front-seat lumbar adjustments, and an 8-inch touchscreen (with  Ford's Sync 3 interface and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), while the Lariat boasts keyless entry and  ignition, power-adjustable pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and  leather upholstery. At the top of the food chain, the King Ranch, Platinum and Limited deliver escalating layers of  top-shelf luxury fittings across the board, only some of which are available as  options on lesser trims.;Last  but not least, the off-road-focused F-150 Raptor drops down to XLT-level standard equipment (many niceties are optional). But it  offers a reinforced frame, a special four-wheel-drive system, a modified  long-travel suspension, Fox shocks, flared fenders, skid plates, upgraded  off-road tires, and distinctive interior trim with leather and cloth  upholstery. ;",
  "Pros": "High towing and payload capacities are ideal for work or play;Comfort and safety tech runs the gamut from blue-collar basic to luxury living;Multiple engines deliver balance of power and fuel economy;Raptor model's gonzo off-road ability;",
  "Cons": "Ride can be rough with an unladen bed;Fell short of some fuel economy estimates in our real-world testing;",
  "What's new": "Advanced driving aids now grouped into packages, with some standard on Lariat and above models and others on the Limited model;New appearance packages for XL, XLT and Lariat trims;4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot is now standard;Part of the 13th F-150 generation introduced for 2015;",
